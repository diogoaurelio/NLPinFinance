    "# Searching For Simple Patterns\n",
    "#### Thanks to Udacity\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to match letters and metacharacters is the simplest task that regular expressions can do. In this section we will see how we can use regular expressions to perform more complex pattern matching. We can form any pattern we want by using the metacharacters mentioned in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first metacharacter we are going to look at is the backslash (`\\`). We already saw that the backslash can be used to escape all the metacharacters, so that you can search for them directly. However, the backslash can also be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. Here is a list of the special sequences we are going to look at in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` - Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the set [0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\D` - Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the set [^0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\s` - Matches any whitespace character, this is equivalent to the set [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\S` - Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the set [^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\w` - Matches any alphanumeric character and the underscore; this is equivalent to the set [a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\W` - Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the set [^a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there is a difference between lowercase and uppercase sequences. For example, while `\\d` matches any digit, `\\D` matches everything that is **not** a digit. Similarly, while `\\s` matches any whitespace character, `\\S` matches everything that is **not** a whitespace character; and while `\\w` matches any alphanumeric character, `\\W` matches everything that is **not** an alphanumeric character.\n",
    "\n",

Therefore, if we want to find all the names of the mountains we need to indicate in our regular expression that the period (`.`) in the abbreviation is optional. We can do this by using the `?` metacharacter in our regular expression. The `?` will match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding regular expression. For example, the regular expression `ab?` will match either `a` or `ab`. In other words, the `?` after the `b` indicates that the `b` after the `a` is optional. Let’s see how this works.\n",

    "# Substitutions with Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do more sophisticated substitutions by using groups. Let's see an example. In the code below we have a multi-line string that contains the names of 4 people. As we can see, some people have middle names but other don't. Let's use the `.sub()` method to replace all names in the string with just the first and last name. For example, the name `John David Smith` should be replaced by `John Smith` and `Alice Jackson` should stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create a regular expression that matches all the names in the list. Now, keeping in mind that we need to be able to make replacements later we will use groups to be able to distinguish between the first name, the middle name, and the last name. Since all names have a first name then we can use this group `([a-zA-z]+)` to match all the first names. Now, not all names have middle names, so having a middle name is optional. Since the first and middle name are separated by a whitespace we also need to indicate that the whitespace is also optional. So, to do indicate that the whitespace and middle name are optional we will include the `?` metacharacter after the whitespace and second group, `[ ]?([a-zA-z]+)?`. After the first or middle name we have a whitespace that we can match with `\\[  \\]`. Notice that in this case we didn't use the sequence `\\\\s` since this will match newlines as well and we don't what match those. Finally we make a third group to match the last name. Since all names have last names, we don't need to use the `?` metacharacter. Putting all together we get:"

    "# Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw at the beginning of this lesson that regexes are case sensitive, therefore we often have to use regexes with both uppercase and lower case letters. However, the `re.compile(pattern, flags)` function, has a `flag` keyword that can be used to allow more flexibility. For example, the `re.IGNORECASE` flag can be used to perform **case-insensitive** matching. In the code below we have a string that contains the name Walter written in two different combinations of upper and lower case letters. In order to be able to find this two renditions of Walter, we will probably have to use a long character set to be able to account for all possible combinations of lower and upper case letters. However, in this case we can use the `re.IGNORECASE` to indicate that we don't care about the case of the letters, we just want to find the name Walter no matter how it is written. Let's see how this works:"
